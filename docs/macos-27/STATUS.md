# Ice on macOS 27 -- what this fork does and does not do

**In one line: on macOS 27 this fork can *see* the menu bar but cannot *hide*
anything.** It lists your items and sorts them into sections. Hiding a section
has no effect, and the fork detects and reports that.

Every row is tagged. **MEASURED** means it was observed on the build and date
given, on one machine: macOS 27.0 (26A428), Apple Silicon, one 1728 x 1117
built-in display, the owner's own menu bar items. **INFERRED** means it was read
from the code or reasoned from measurements, and was not observed. No row is a
general guarantee: other machines, displays, item sets and macOS builds are
untested. The evidence and its limits are in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md).

## What works

| what | status | tag |
|---|---|---|
| Launch no longer sticks at "Loading menu bar items..." | setup finished 1.1 s after start; the text appeared in none of three search panels and none of two layout panes | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |
| Items are found through Accessibility | the search panel's names and right-to-left order matched the bar | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |
| Discovery keeps up | 41 passes in five minutes; 40 `complete` (median 36.5 ms); only the cold launch pass was `incomplete` | MEASURED, Ice `28b89c2`, 2026-09-25 19:18 |
| Sections follow Ice's dividers | after a divider had been collapsed for at least 1 s: Visible 6 / Hidden 5, matching the items' positions, over two show/hide cycles | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |
| Your items survive a collapse, an expand and Ice quitting | 9 collapses: no `«` chevron, no item lost, items moved by 1 pt or less; after quitting, all 10 items were back in the same order | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |
| Permissions | all checks passed and no prompt appeared | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |

## What does not work

| what | status | tag |
|---|---|---|
| **Hiding** | an expanded hidden divider hides nothing: in 10 of 10 checks the item was still drawn | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |
| The hiding check tells you so | the layout settings showed `Hiding did not take effect for 5 item(s)` | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |
| The check after a collapse of under 1 s | `Not checked: noBaseline` | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |
| The check in IceBar mode | `Not checked: iceBarMode`: no click collapses a divider there, so nothing is sectioned or checked | INFERRED (code) |
| Item images in the search panel | blank grey placeholders | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25 |
| Moving, clicking or temporarily showing an item | refused and logged; a click in the search panel does nothing | INFERRED (code) |
| Apple's own items (the clock, Control Centre) and apps that refuse Accessibility | not listed | INFERRED (code) |
| Before a divider has first been collapsed for 1 s after launch | every item is listed under Visible | INFERRED (code) |
| Ice's menu bar item service (XPC) | fails to start within 45 ms, and setup, which waits for it, then goes on. That build was ad-hoc signed with no team, while the service only accepts a peer from the same team; a signed release was not run on 27 | MEASURED, Ice `2e0c553`, 2026-09-25; the signing cause INFERRED |

## Why hiding does not work, and what is next

Ice hides items by widening its own status item so that the items to its left
are pushed off the bar. On macOS 27, at the width Ice uses (10 000 pt) the
widened item gives the room back and nothing is hidden. At the narrower widths
that do push an item out, the item lands in the system's overflow, which shows a
`«` chevron. Both were MEASURED on test helpers on 2026-09-18; that the same
holds for Ice's own item is INFERRED. The owner has stopped the push-out
approach.
Whether there is any hiding mechanism on 27 that stays reliable and recoverable
across layouts, app switches and Spaces is the next study. If no such mechanism
is found, this fork will state that macOS 27 support is read-only.

Not verifiable on this machine: macOS 14 to 26 (the machine runs 27 only).
